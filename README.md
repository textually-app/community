# The Textually Community

[Textually][textually-app] is an inclusive and predominantly
text-based dating app that I am starting to sketch out. The app
experience encourages you to be as authentic and honest as possible
about who you are and what you want. To get a better sense of my
initial ideas for Textually, please read [more about the
app][textually-about].

Here is where we catalogue ideas to grow the ideal community around
Textually, starting with the [rules of the service][textually-rules].

If you find this interesting or have related ideas, please [talk to
me][harish-contact]. I‚Äôd love to collaborate on this. üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
