# Rules for joining Textually


1. Please be single or ethically non-monogamous. Textually is a place
   to find romantic love, so it’s important that you be authentic and
   available. 💫
2. Please follow our guidance and think deeply about who you are and
   what you’re looking for. You will need to articulate this in your
   profile with honesty. 😇
3. Please be kind, courteous and respectful of other’s privacy. Don’t
   stalk, harass or doxx others. Don’t be a catfish and break anyone’s
   heart. 🙏
4. This is a safe space for all people (regardless of neurodivergence,
   whether you’re LGBTQIA2S+, what your skin colour is, ...). Be
   tolerant and help each other out. ❤️
5. If you’re a sex worker, you aren’t allowed to join in a
   professional capacity. You’re obviously most welcome here to look
   for love in your personal life. 🤗   
6. Keep the main timeline safe for work. If you do wish to publish
   intimate posts, please use Content Warnings so that those who don’t
   wish to see them aren’t forced to. Illegal content such as child
   pornography, unsurprisingly, is not permitted. ⚠️
7. You must be at least 18 years or older on the date of registration
   to hold an account on this service. 🔞
